    "Obtain": "Alright, alright, I'll indulge you with a little fun. After all... the way you're trailing after me is just too adorable.",
    "RP1": "It's only natural that the owner of Whitestone Industries is highly competent.",
    "RP3": "You've got to show what you're made of once in a while. Am I right, Chief?",
    "LevelStart": "Come grab a drink with me when it's done.",
    "Win": "The job is done! Shall we sort out the pay?",
    "Lose": "When there's a will, there's a— which way is the exit?",
    "Ultimate": "You are all done for.",
    "Death": "Take care of them... please...",
    "Greeting": "MBCC's Whitestone Branch at your service! If you drop by, I'll offer you a special 20% off. Shush... don't let K.K. know.",
    "Convo1": "Time for bed. I've earned it, haven't I? I've been working so hard for you, Chief.",
    "Convo2": "I'm faster than lightning when I want to be. You won't be able to stop me. Hmm, you think I'm bluffing? Try setting me free and see for yourself then.",
    "Convo3": "Whitestone is able to survive in Syndicate till today because I've poured my blood, sweat, and tears into this company. You really can't count on those two kids, for heaven's sake... Why are you looking at me like this? Am I not speaking the truth?",
    "SConvo1": "I don't have any virtuous faith. I'm happy enough to be able to protect those around me. I don't want to lose anyone ever again.",
    "SConvo2": "Half of those save 10 DisCoins on your order ads in the city are posted by me. I've been to every corner of the DisCity, and I know about the things you want to investigate. Wanna hear it? ...Well, pay up!",
    "SConvo3": "Underground city? Why on earth are you always looking into this sort of thing... Has anyone seen it? If no one has seen it, that means it's fake. Or... no one who's entered it has made it out alive.",
    "Compliance": "I don't like working hard, but I do like hard-working people. People like K.K., Che... and you. Trust me, your hard effort won't go to waste—I won't let that happen.",
    "Idle": "The meals here are pretty good. I don't need to repay my debts here. Also, the landlord can't just barge in. Nice, nice... It's decided, I'm not leaving!",
    "Annoyed": "Oh? How unusual. Are you taking the lead today? In that case, let's have some fun...",
    "SAttention": "Are you so eager to be close to me? Oh my, such an honest kid.",
    "Dispatch": "Does this count as a job? You know the drill, I don't work for free.",
    "DispatchC": "Phew... Should have asked K.K. to settle this for me...",
    "LevelUp": "Whatever you say, whatever you need.",
    "Deploy": "Oh? Try to keep up with me, you guys.",
    "Pat": "Handsy. Fancy going for a ride with me, Chief?"

    "Obtain": "So you finally found out. Don't be shocked. Syndicate has quite a few dank rats lurking in the dark. Someone's got to deal with them. It's really no trouble for me.",
    "LevelUp": "The faster the blade, the fewer problems there are.",
    "Greeting": "You're finally back. I stayed here and didn't go out all this time when you were gone... Oh, you want to know about the stain on my cloak? Che accidentally spilled water on it. Yeah, that must be it.",
    "Pat": "These hair accessories all have their own purposes. Be careful not to cut your hands.",
    "OT1": "Errands? What errands would a decent person have this late... I simply enjoy walking around at night. Yup, that's all.",
    "OT2": "There is a restaurant nearby. Their braised beef goes well with wine. Let's grab a drink together?",
    "OT3": "With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st in the skies... What a beautiful night to sweep away vice.",
    "OT4": "If you slash a blade fast enough, an afterimage will linger in its place. Beautiful, isn't it?",
    "Idle": "Hmm, this familiar stench... Is it coming from over there?",
    "SAttention": "Is this meant to... surveil me? Which do you think is faster, the speed of my movement or the blink of your eye?"

    "Obtain": "Believe me, I've really been to the sea! I chartered a luxury yacht and found a lot of treasures there... (Chuckles) K.K. and Che were there, too! They can vouch for me!",
    "LevelUp": "Hehe, afterwards, I found even more treasures.",
    "Greeting": "Done resting? Let's head out, then. There are still lots of treasures at the bottom of the sea waiting for us to salvage.",
    "Pat": "When you're alone on a boat with a hot babe like me, your imagination is bound to run wild. It's fine, I forgive you.",
    "OT1": "You know, my boat back then was unparalleled. Powerful, luxurious, and decked out with every gadget you can possibly imagine... What's that look? Don't believe that I used to be rich?",
    "OT2": "It can get dangerous at times on the sea. There are storms, pirates, and sharks. But fear not. To me, those are just little hiccups on the road to fortune.",
    "OT3": "Can I swim? Ha! I can swim like a little mermaid, so fast, so graceful! Anyone sees that should pay me. You'll understand once I get into the water.",
    "OT4": "Phew, the sun is scorching. I'm getting all hot and sweaty... Aww, how come you're blushing?",
    "Idle": "Ah... Take a nap on the deck if you're tired. The sun is so warm, and the sea breeze feels so nice...",
    "SAttention": "All right, all hands on deck. We're heading to deeper waters!"
